# Sales-Data-Analysis
[I have also attached all month One CSV file and every month CSV file]

In this project, i analyzed the sales data of XYZ Company for the year 2019 using my programming skills. The main goal of this project was to prepare the data for data mining and analysis. To achieve this, i needed to understand, gather, explore, and analyze the data. Initially, i gained a basic understanding of the data and its features. Afterward, i developed a Python program to merge the data from all months into a single CSV file. This Python program provided summary statistics, correlations of variables, and data analysis. Additionally, we used various data visualization techniques, such as bar graphs, pie charts, and histograms, to explore the data and make it more accessible with appropriate labels.

In this coursework, i was tasked with understanding, analyzing, and exploring the sales data of XYZ Company for the year 2019. To accomplish this, i leveraged the Python programming language and utilized several Python libraries, including:

- Pandas: An open-source library used for data analysis and manipulation. Pandas is known for its speed, power, flexibility, and ease of use.
  
- NumPy: A fundamental package for scientific computing in Python, providing multidimensional arrays and a range of routines for efficient array operations.
  
- Seaborn: A visualization library for statistical graphics in Python, offering visually appealing default styles and color palettes to enhance statistical plots.
  
- OS: The OS module, which facilitates interactions with the operating system, providing a portable way to access OS-dependent functionality.
  
- Matplotlib: A cross-platform data visualization and plotting library for Python, suitable for various types of plots, including histograms, scatter plots, and bar charts.

These libraries played a crucial role in my project, enabling me to complete our data analysis and exploration tasks effectively.
